# Wifi analyzer

A program for testing the wifi-connection.

## Setup

**Step 1: .env**

Correct values in `.env`

**Step 2: Venv**

Read the "Venv"-section of the Makefile.

## Useful commands

```
#  Trace the dig
dig +trace google.com
```

...Is it resolving the IP in the router? 


```
# Wi-Fi info
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -I

# Ping and traceroute
ping 8.8.8.8
traceroute 8.8.8.8
```
